### Developing

It is recommended to install `direnv` and `lefthook` to a better development process.

* [direnv](https://direnv.net/)
* [lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook)

```
make setup-env
```

This will install the Git Hooks and create an `.env` file from the `.env.example` template. You will need to add your backblaze keys there.

You can start a test Postgres container as well an application container using: `make dev`.

All the core logic is placed on `backup.sh` script at the root of this repository. This file is mounted as a volume on the docker container, so you can easily change it and see your changes.
